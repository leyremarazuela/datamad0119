# Pipelines Project

## Overview

The goal of this project is to investigate which parameters are more important in measuring average happinness levels in different countries.
The "Happiness Score" is a metric measured in 2015 by asking the sampled people the question: "How would you rate your happiness on a scale of 0 to 10 where 10 is the happiest." For this project, I will use the Dataset of World Happinness Report
(https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness#2015.csv) from Kaggle.

Our null hypothesis is that family and economic situation are significant determinants in the level of happinness. The alternative hypothesis, therefore, is that there is generally no greater high correlation between these attributes and the incidence of happinness.

Overall the project consists of a series of steps as outlined below.

## Intro: Understand info contained in data

> 1. Country = Name of the country.
> 2. Region = Region the country belongs to.
> 3. Happiness Rank = Rank of the country based on the Happiness Score.
> 4. Happiness Score = A metric measured in 2015 by asking the sampled people the question: "How would you rate your happiness on a scale of 0 to 10 where 10 is the happiest."
> 5. Standard Error = The standard error of the happiness score.
> 6. Economy (GDP per Capita) = The extent to which GDP contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score.
> 7. Family = The extent to which Family contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score
> 8. Health (Life Expectancy) = The extent to which Life expectancy contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score
> 9. Freedom = The extent to which Freedom contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score.
> 10. Trust (Government Corruption) = The extent to which Perception of Corruption contributes to Happiness Score.
> 11. Generosity = The extent to which Generosity contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score.
> 12. Dystopia Residual = The extent to which Dystopia Residual contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score.
