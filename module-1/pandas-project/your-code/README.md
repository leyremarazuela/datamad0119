# Pandas Project: Demonstration of Data Cleaning and Manipulation with Pandas

## Overview

The goal of this project is to investigate in which countries there incidence of shark accidents is greater. For this project, I will use the Dataset of Global Shark Attacks (https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks) from Kaggle.

Our null hypothesis is that certain countries have higher incidence of shark accidents than others. The alternative hypothesis, therefore, is that there is generally no greater incidents of shark accidents on certain countries.

Overall the project consists of a series of steps as outlined below. In summary, I will import the dataset, use  data wrangling skills to clean it up, prepare it to be analyzed, and then export it as a clean CSV data file.

## Step 0: Understand info contained in data

The dataset comes from the 29th of September of 2016. 
Each row corresponds to a shark attack and the columns include:

* Date
* Year
* Type
* Country
* Area
* Location
* Activity
* Name
* Sex
* Age
* Injury
* Fatal (Y/N)
* Time
* Species
* Investigator or Source


## Step 1: Import the data using Pandas.

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

* **A cleaned CSV data file** containing the results of your data wrangling work.
* **A Jupyter Notebook (data-wrangling.ipynb)** containing all Python code and commands used in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data set.
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of the process followed in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data as well as your results, obstacles encountered, and lessons learned.

## Step 2: Examine the data for potential issues.

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

* **A cleaned CSV data file** containing the results of your data wrangling work.
* **A Jupyter Notebook (data-wrangling.ipynb)** containing all Python code and commands used in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data set.
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of the process followed in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data as well as your results, obstacles encountered, and lessons learned.

## Step 3: Manipulate and Clean Data.

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

* **A cleaned CSV data file** containing the results of your data wrangling work.
* **A Jupyter Notebook (data-wrangling.ipynb)** containing all Python code and commands used in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data set.
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of the process followed in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data as well as your results, obstacles encountered, and lessons learned.

## Step 3: Manipulate and Clean Data.

* **Find a messy data set** - a great place to start looking would be [Awesome Public Data Sets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) and [Kaggle Data Sets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).
* **Examine the data and try to understand what the fields mean** before diving into data cleaning and manipulation methods.
* **Break the project down into different steps** - use the topics covered in the lessons to form a check list, add anything else you can think of that may be wrong with your data set, and then work through the check list.
* **Use the tools in your tool kit** - your knowledge of Python, data structures, Pandas, and data wrangling.
* **Work through the lessons in class** & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your project each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often**, donâ€™t be afraid of doing something incorrectly because you can always roll back to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation and resources provided** to better understand the tools you are using and how to accomplish what you want.


## Step 4: Export clean CSV version of your data using Pandas.

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

* **A cleaned CSV data file** containing the results of your data wrangling work.
* **A Jupyter Notebook (data-wrangling.ipynb)** containing all Python code and commands used in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data set.
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of the process followed in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data as well as your results, obstacles encountered, and lessons learned.

## Step 5: Export Jupyter Notebook.

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

* **A cleaned CSV data file** containing the results of your data wrangling work.
* **A Jupyter Notebook (data-wrangling.ipynb)** containing all Python code and commands used in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data set.
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of the process followed in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data as well as your results, obstacles encountered, and lessons learned.
